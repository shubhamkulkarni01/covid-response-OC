# covid-response-OC
The [OC Covid 19 Community Watch](https://www.occiviccoders.com/covid-response-OC/) was made to help the local community with covid-19. Data provided by [OC Public Health Care Agency](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus).  



## Getting Started

* Clone this repo.  
* Make sure you have NPM, and run `npm install`.
* There is a node file to scrape data from the OC Public Health website, that's currently manually run with the `nmp run get` command.  This copies data into `assets/js/db.js`. 
* After running, I sanity check the data, then run the following command to write out the frontend javascript and json files `npm run write`.  This copies data into `assets/js/data.js` and `assets/js/currentData.json`.  It's a messy process, but a quick and dirty solution for having no back end, with much room for improvement.
* I made a script to push the data to github `npm run push`.

## Built With

### Front End
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front end framework
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Needs no introduction
* [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/) - Nice charts
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - For the map
* [d3js](https://d3js.org/) - For the map pareto
* [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For the nice icons

## Back End
The backend has no real server.  Just me running scripts and pushing for now.
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - For scraping and running scripts
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - For compiling ES6 in node so that I can push/pull data from `assets/js/data.js`
* [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - To minify and publish JS/CSS from the `src` folder to `public` folder.
